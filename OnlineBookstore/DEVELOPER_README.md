## 1. Introduction
This document is a comprehensive guide for developers who want to build or extend the OnlineBookstore web application. It follows the phases of the software engineering lifecycle and details all requirements, design choices, and best practices.

---

## 2. Software Engineering Process Overview
The development of OnlineBookstore follows a structured software engineering process:
- **Requirements Analysis**: Gather and document all functional and non-functional requirements.
- **System Design**: Define architecture, database schema, and UI/UX.
- **Implementation**: Develop features in modular, testable components.
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.
- **Deployment**: Prepare for production, configure servers, and launch.
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing bug fixes, improvements, and feature additions.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements
- User registration and authentication (students, teachers, admins, individuals)
- Book catalog with search, filter, and detailed views
- Book ordering and order management
- Online reading (PDF/HTML) and audiobook streaming
- Quizzes linked to books, with results tracking
- User dashboard with stats, progress, and recommendations
- Admin/teacher dashboards for managing users, books, quizzes, and analytics
- Reading progress tracking
- Personalized recommendations
- Responsive, modern UI

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Fast page loads, efficient database queries
- **Security**: Password hashing, prepared statements, session management, XSS protection
- **Scalability**: Modular codebase, scalable database structure
- **Maintainability**: Clear code organization, documentation, and comments
- **Usability**: Intuitive navigation, accessibility for all users
- **Portability**: Runs on standard LAMP/WAMP stack
- **Reliability**: Error handling, data validation, backup strategies

---

## 5. System Architecture & Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (vanilla + Chart.js)
- **Backend**: PHP (OOP/MVC structure recommended)
- **Database**: MySQL (normalized schema, foreign keys)
- **Other**: FontAwesome, Google Fonts, AJAX for dynamic features

---

## 6. Development Phases
### 6.1. Requirements Analysis
- Interview stakeholders, define user stories, and clarify all features.
- Document all requirements in a shared location.

### 6.2. System Design
- Draw DFDs, ERDs, and UI wireframes.
- Define database schema and API endpoints.
- Plan directory structure and coding standards.

### 6.3. Implementation
- Set up version control (Git recommended).
- Scaffold project directories.
- Implement features module-by-module:
  - Auth, Catalog, Orders, Reading, Audio, Quizzes, Dashboard, Admin
- Write clear, reusable code with comments.

### 6.4. Testing
- Write unit tests for PHP functions/classes.
- Test database queries and edge cases.
- Perform integration and user acceptance testing.

### 6.5. Deployment
- Prepare database and server configs.
- Deploy to production/staging environment.
- Monitor logs and fix post-launch issues.

### 6.6. Maintenance
- Regularly update dependencies and patch security issues.
- Gather user feedback for improvements.

---

## 7. Database Design
- See `setup.sql` for full schema.
- Use foreign keys for referential integrity.
- Store passwords hashed (never plain text).
- Use prepared statements for all queries.

---

## 8. Security Practices
- Escape all user input/output (prevent XSS).
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Limit file upload types and sanitize filenames.
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Regularly audit code for vulnerabilities.

---

## 9. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Use PHPUnit (or similar) for backend testing.
- Manual and automated browser testing for UI.
- Validate forms on both client and server.
- Test for SQL injection, XSS, and authentication bypasses.

---

## 10. Deployment & Maintenance
- Use environment variables for sensitive configs.
- Back up database and files regularly.
- Document deployment steps in a `DEPLOY.md` file.
- Monitor for errors and performance issues.

---

## 11. Example API Endpoints
Document your backend endpoints for clarity and reusability. Example:

### User Registration
- **POST** `/api/register`
  - **Body:** `{ "username": "string", "password": "string", "email": "string", "role": "string" }`
  - **Response:** `{ "success": true, "user_id": 123 }`

### Book Catalog
- **GET** `/api/books`
  - **Query Params:** `?search=term&author=authorname`
  - **Response:** `[ { "id": 1, "title": "Book Title", ... }, ... ]`

### Place Order
- **POST** `/api/order`
  - **Body:** `{ "user_id": 123, "book_id": 5 }`
  - **Response:** `{ "success": true, "order_id": 456 }`

---

## 12. Example Code Snippets

### Registration (PHP, OOP style)
```php
// RegistrationController.php
public function register($data) {
    $username = $data['username'];
    $password = password_hash($data['password'], PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
    // ...validate and insert into DB using prepared statements
}
```

### Catalog Query (PHP)
```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare('SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE ?');
$search = "%$searchTerm%";
$stmt->bind_param('s', $search);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
```

### Place Order (PHP)
```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare('INSERT INTO orders (user_id, book_id) VALUES (?, ?)');
$stmt->bind_param('ii', $userId, $bookId);
$stmt->execute();
```

---

## 13. Testing & Quality Assurance (Expanded)
- **Unit Testing:** Use PHPUnit for backend logic, functions, and classes.
- **Integration Testing:** Test workflows (e.g., registration to order) using tools like Postman or automated scripts.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Use Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright to test user flows in the browser.
- **Manual Testing:** Validate UI/UX, edge cases, and accessibility.
- **Security Testing:** Attempt SQL injection, XSS, and authentication bypasses.

---

## 14. CI/CD & Deployment Automation
- Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar for automated testing and deployment.
- Example workflow:
  - On push: run linting, run tests, build assets, deploy to staging.
  - On release: deploy to production, run post-deploy checks.
- Store secrets (DB credentials, API keys) in environment variables.
- Document deployment in `DEPLOY.md`.

---

## 15. Project Conventions
- **Branching:** Use `main`/`master` for production, `develop` for staging, feature branches for new features.
- **Code Style:** PSR-12 for PHP, ESLint for JS, Prettier for formatting.
- **Commit Messages:** Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add user registration`, `fix: correct SQL bug`).
- **Pull Requests:** Require review and CI checks before merging.
